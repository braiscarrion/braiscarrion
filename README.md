# Hey! I'm Brais! 👋

Ever since I was a little boy I always liked the world of computers.

The first thing I ever coded was a square made of asterisks at school when I was only seven years old. Years went by and I decided to study programming in a more in-depth way, until it became my full time job.

## I'm a Software Developer

For the last few years, I´ve been working on international projects. Mainly developing web applications using JS frameworks and Java REST services.
But in my free time I like to try new technologies and test random ideas that cross my mind on a daily basis.

Here are some of my repositories 😄
